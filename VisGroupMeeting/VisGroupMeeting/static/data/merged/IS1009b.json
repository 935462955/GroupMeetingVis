I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.

Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate.

If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it.

Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much.
