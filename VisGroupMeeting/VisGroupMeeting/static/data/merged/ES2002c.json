For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use. So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this. Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority. Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture.

Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it."}, {"startTime": "383.17", "endTime": "450.57", "role": "D", "text": "And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case.

Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout. That was like the number three thing. And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons.

Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity. Um Does that make sense? Yeah.
