If you can display them it's perfect. Uh do you all have a copy of them? I have some paper copies. Uh you're welcome. So actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was um history , drama , action , and given also that , well , we decided to to present this month a movie from the the nineties , um I thought that among these movies , who look quite popular , uh Saving Private Ryan would be a very good candidate. Um actually it's a movie I've seen. Have you seen it before? Okay , so you've all seen it , so maybe everyone has seen it , I'm not very sure. Um but I think it's a very novel treatment of of war , it's uh it's no longer the b glorification of uh , whatever , combat and victory , but the plot is quite different , it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed , so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family , and saving means actually removing from the the front , if you if re if you remember the plot. So in fact this guy , the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor , the the main a well , the main character is uh played by Tom Hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes uh Captain John Miller. So he is sent with this rather strange mission , which is not a combat mission , but they uh they want just to to get this guy back , which is in fact this guy is I think behind enemy lines or something like this. So it happens in in Europe , just after the the Normandy landing , and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's it's very dramatic , it's uh it's not , you know , like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously , but here they well , you see everything and you see how many people die on that day. It's actually Well it's very strange , you could s ask this for any sad movie , did you enjoy it. Well I didn't really enjoy to see bad things , but uh I think it was satisfying to see that , well , how dramatic things are. Yeah. Exactly , yeah. I it's very moving , I it's true , it's not very it's not very , well , happy. I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now , if it's darker or maybe Yeah. So yeah , so I think this would continue a bit our our theme. So the the movie is ranked quite high , if I if I refer back to your table it's number uh , what actually , um fourteen. Quite a lot of votes , so um also one of the the mainstream movies. Um on the second page uh of my notes I well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting , we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation. Um especially I enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation.
