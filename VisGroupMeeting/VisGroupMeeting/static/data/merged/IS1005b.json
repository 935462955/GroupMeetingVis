Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_. Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it. Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls. Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control. And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control. Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_. Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour.
