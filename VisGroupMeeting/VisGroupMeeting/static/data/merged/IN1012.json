So a lot of people participated in uh I think even they're continuing this for uh next year and Text to speech. But uh I heard like even for I_CASSP next year there is some com uh like computation by Martin Krug , Sheffield , and on this feature extraction stuff and so at least if you make task simple focus , then it may be good to compare these features and but if you s use some uh large vocabulary system , it takes t six months to build and at the end you don't know whether your features are really uh so.
