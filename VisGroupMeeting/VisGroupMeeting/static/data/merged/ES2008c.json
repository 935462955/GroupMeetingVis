Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into. And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery. Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light. But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing. But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down. Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_.
