So I I found a couple of examples that were kinda like that. Mm but the the problem that I found when I ran it , uh the th the thing that was a bad point was that if you have uh say tryin I was trying to say if you could evaluate this with search given some keywords like which model would more likely find you a p good document , that that sort of approach. Uh what I found was that say you had uh Uh th tha that's not too relevant necessarily , but if you have say a topic distribution for uh one page , and it very very highly scores on the P_L_S_A_ for one of the the topics , and that's right , okay , this model , because it's averaging out over all the pages nearby , all of the topic distributions become more flat.
