I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing. And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it. And I would encourage you all to do the same. Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful. Um people like something that really fits in their hand. Simple is beautiful. They don't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing. They want each button to do something. And eye-catching is important. It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing. Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition. Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item. And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign. If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal. They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them.
