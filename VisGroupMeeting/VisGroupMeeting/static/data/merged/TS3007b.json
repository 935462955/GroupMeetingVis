Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into.

Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function. So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote. If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be. But it may be uh may be something to explore. Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components. Uh first you have the energy source.
