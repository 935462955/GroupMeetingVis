So any changes you make to one are made to the other , and if you do that around five corners , you lose track of it and you suddenly wonder why that value is zero. And it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway uh So we figured out it's interesting , why don't I have a screen here now actually that's new , but that's okay. It's doing different things all the time. Like this is the first time that actually the but uh uh that should be okay that should be okay.

Yeah , I've derived that I've derived that myself. Like I didn't find it so I did it myself and it took me a day with the formula. But then I'm slow at maths.

No. So I've worked around that there is ways I think to get around it , but the problem is So you b you basically we have to we have to have two code versions then , one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on.

But now r no , but it doesn't have to. Even now it doesn't have to. Okay , well that's all details. Um so Dave , can you just turn this what we have right now in Yeah. Make Uh And if an If anyone feels that they have free time , uh this is a joke , um one thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things and which I haven't found out about it is how to do tool tips in an arbitrary way in in in Swing graphic displays. Now there is simple ways of doing tool tips over a given element , like if you have a button and you just give it a tool tip text. But there is means of doing tool tips that just I c I put my mouse over. Let's say I put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is. And that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display in the in the way that just when the mouse is over it , but I haven't figured out how it works , and that's something that probably so if everyone is ever bored or anyone feels that they can do that Yes , but Yeah , but the the thing is it it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip. There seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or Yeah. So anyway , I haven't looked much into that. So if if anybody looks into that , then let me know. Otherwise I'll start looking into it as soon as I have time again. But if anybody Yeah. I found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding , like I saw half-page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and I didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that. So if anybody gets any good samples of that Never.
