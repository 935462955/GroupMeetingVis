And the recognition network was wrong and you owe me money or whatever. Um and then they can say well we've we've reconstructed your speech from the speech recogni input to the speech recognizer. Hey voila it sounds like you uh Uh I mean obviously there's a lot more to it than that. There's a lot of sort of , well , does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever. But um Oh no , that there's a separate set of standards I think for speech recognition. Y yeah , yeah , yeah. Yep. Which uh I think requires , you know , that states the un the information they can send is this. So I don't know whether you tack on any extra phase information or whatever. You have to deal with what you're given. So Yeah. I don't know. I I it would be interesting.
