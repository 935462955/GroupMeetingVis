So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver. So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later. But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_. And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option."}, {"startTime": "1273.33", "endTime": "1273.52", "role": "A", "text": "Mm-hmm."}, {"startTime": "1275.08", "endTime": "1275.23", "role": "A", "text": "Yep."}, {"startTime": "1308.33", "endTime": "1308.42", "role": "D", "text": "Mm-hmm."}, {"startTime": "1341.62", "endTime": "1341.73", "role": "B", "text": "Mm."}, {"startTime": "1342.37", "endTime": "1342.51", "role": "D", "text": "Yep."}, {"startTime": "1365.84", "endTime": "1397.6", "role": "C", "text": "And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh.
