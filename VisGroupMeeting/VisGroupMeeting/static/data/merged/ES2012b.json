So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do. Um and then there are two different kinds that I found. There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be."}, {"startTime": "1265.02", "endTime": "1265.45", "role": "A", "text": "Alright."}, {"startTime": "1290.98", "endTime": "1291.3", "role": "A", "text": "Mm-hmm."}, {"startTime": "1295.72", "endTime": "1363.46", "role": "C", "text": "So these are the two different ones. This one um this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use. So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that. And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours. And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons.

Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it.
