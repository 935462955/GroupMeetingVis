Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing. Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well. Uh um So , the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department.
