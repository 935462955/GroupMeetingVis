Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design. All ready to go? Okay. Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder. Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time. Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is. Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control. Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market. So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_. And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design."}, {"startTime": "27.38", "endTime": "28.53", "role": "D", "text": "Could you plug me in?"}, {"startTime": "32.04", "endTime": "34.09", "role": "D", "text": "Okay.

'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through. So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products. Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics. Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um Dunno. Okay. Um. So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together. Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. So they find them ugly. Most people find them ugly. Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition. Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second. Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls.

It just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better. Um okay , you need some power source. 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going. Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last. Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want. Like for example , voice recognition , right. That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there. Um Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever. You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_. So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay. Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here. Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um. It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power. So it's not really a constraint in that sense , but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , what the technology has to do.
