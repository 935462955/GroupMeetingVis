If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh everything else is kind of Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like. So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there.
