So we'll show you two slightly different presentations. Feel free to ask any questions or comments , obviously. Um the first one was done by myself , Bruno , Marianne and Nikos. And the rationale that we have , I'll show you the layout in a second , was that full professors would get private offices. Administration is close to the professors offices , so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone. The fax is in the administration office , since it's mostly used by Gisella , who's the secretary. For noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together , and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall. Um , so I'll just show you how that works. Basically , you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine , and Maggie and Susan , who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices. And the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes."}, {"startTime": "9.86", "endTime": "10.23", "role": "B", "text": "Okay."}, {"startTime": "27.16", "endTime": "27.59", "role": "B", "text": "Mm-hmm."}, {"startTime": "59.72", "endTime": "162.53", "role": "A", "text": "Um , just to go back , most people are grouped in projects.

And the reading room , or the lounge as some people call it , that we have is in a central position. So basically we've got Andre and Nancy at the top. Um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together , if um if I'm not mistaken. Like I said , Susan and Maggie in the individual offices. Nikos and Yalina , who work on the same project , at the bottom. The reading room is in the middle. Um , Marianne and Bruno are at the bottom.

So as I said , the half times are in the three person offices. And on the other side we have Maria , Martin and myself , who all work on the same project. And Martin is fifty per cent.
